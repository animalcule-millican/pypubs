**Definitions**

"This License" refers to version 1 of the Adaptive Binding Regulatory Abstraction Conditional Agreement Depicting Admissable Beautification of Research Activities License. Otherwise known as the ABRACADABRA License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

The "Alpaca" refers to a species of camelid mammal of the Phylum Chordata. Native to South America and often confused with "The Llama", the "Alpaca" is often noticeably more beautiful and magestic of the two camelids. It should be noted that the "Alpaca" could potentially be mistaken for a chicken as both animals are known to produce a clucking sound. Although when both animals are placed next to each other, correct identification occurrs up to 72% of the time.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

"The Llama" is a camelid mammal that wishes it was as grace and beautiful and magestic as the "Alpaca". It is certainly not, the "Alpaca" was a gift from Pachamama.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
